 <p>ArCo and SPARQL proved to be extremely useful tools for accessing data related to Italian cultural heritage. By using keywords and queries to identify data gaps, and by consulting the Wikidata knowledge graph, 
	 we were able to detect missing information regarding the Palazzo dei Diamanti. Specifically, we found data related to the author, the use of the building, and the cultural property address of the Pinacoteca Nazionale. 
	 Knowing that the Palazzo dei Diamanti currently hosts the Pinacoteca, we were able to infer its address by discovering the address of the Pinacoteca itself.
	 <br>
	 As for the use of LLMs, they were essential throughout the project, although we observed some differences between them. ChatGPT was particularly helpful for HTML and CSS tasks, even though, in order to obtain fully accurate results, 
	 we had to remake our prompts several times, often using specific examples. For what concerns SPARQL queries, ChatGPT-generated queries were often vague or incorrect. On the contrary, DeepSeek consistently produced queries that were nearly correct and ready to use, 
	 though manual verification was always necessary.
	<br>
To further enrich ArCo knowledge graph, the data we collected could be integrated to fill the identified gaps. In addition, providing a precise IRI for Sigismondo d'Este would be valuable, given the significant role of the Este court during the Italian Renaissaince and its patronage of important monuments. 
	 <br>
	 In conclusion, this project allowed us to develop new and valuable skills, such as data querying and website creation using both HTML and CSS, skills we did not have at the beginning of this course.
